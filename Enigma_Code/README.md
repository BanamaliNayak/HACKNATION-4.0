# Vision AI

*Project Name*: Vision AI  
*Target Audience*: Visually Impaired and Blind People

## Overview

Vision AI is a computer vision-based project designed to improve the daily lives of visually impaired and blind individuals. By using advanced technologies such as object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Vision AI assists in detecting and identifying objects, coins, paper notes, and potential obstacles that visually impaired users might face. Additionally, it helps them read printed text, making it easier to navigate and interact with their environment.

## How It Works in Daily Life

### 1. *Coin Detection*
   - *Daily Use*: When handling money, visually impaired individuals often struggle to distinguish between different coin denominations. Vision AI can quickly and accurately detect coins, informing the user of the coin's value. This enables independent handling of money without the need for assistance, making day-to-day transactions easier.
   - *Example*: A user can place a coin in front of the camera, and Vision AI will identify the coin's denomination (e.g., "This is a 1-rupee coin").

### 2. *Paper Note Detection*
   - *Daily Use*: Recognizing paper currency is essential for shopping, paying bills, or using transportation. Vision AI detects and announces different types of paper notes, helping visually impaired individuals know which denomination they are holding.
   - *Example*: When a user holds a banknote, Vision AI can say, "This is a 500-rupee note" or "This is a 20-dollar bill," enabling the user to handle cash confidently.

### 3. *Obstacle Detection*
   - *Daily Use*: Visually impaired individuals may face unexpected obstacles in their environment, which can lead to accidents or injuries. Vision AI detects obstacles such as furniture, walls, or other objects and alerts the user with audio notifications, helping them avoid potential hazards.
   - *Example*: While walking in a room or corridor, the user can receive real-time alerts like "Obstacle detected in front," or "Step up ahead," allowing them to navigate more safely.

### 4. *OCR (Optical Character Recognition)*
   - *Daily Use*: OCR allows visually impaired individuals to access written information, such as reading signs, menus, labels, or documents. Vision AI converts printed text into speech, enabling users to receive information from books, flyers, or even street signs without the need for braille or additional help.
   - *Example*: A user can point the camera at a document or menu, and Vision AI will read aloud the text, such as "This is a restaurant menu with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options."

## How Vision AI Benefits Visually Impaired and Blind People

1. *Independence*: Vision AI helps users perform everyday tasks such as recognizing money, identifying obstacles, and reading text without relying on others. This boosts confidence and independence in daily life.
   
2. *Safety*: With obstacle detection, Vision AI helps prevent accidents by providing timely warnings about obstacles in the userâ€™s path, ensuring a safer environment.
   
3. *Accessibility*: The OCR feature makes written information accessible to visually impaired individuals by reading aloud text from various sources like documents, labels, and signage, improving their ability to interact with the world around them.
   
4. *Time-Saving*: By automating the identification of coins, paper notes, and obstacles, users save time and effort, allowing them to focus on more important aspects of their daily activities.
